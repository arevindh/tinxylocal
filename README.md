   - Follow the prompts to complete the installation.
   - **Restart Home Assistant** to ensure the new integration loads properly.

### Step 2: Configure Each Device with the Tinxy-Local Integration

1. **Verify Local API Support** (Check Step 3):
   - Before adding a device, confirm that it supports local access.
   - Visit `[device_ip]/info` to ensure that local API support is enabled for that specific device.
2. **Add the Device Using the Tinxy Integration**:
   - Navigate to **Settings** > **Devices & Services** in Home Assistant.
   - Click **Add Integration** and search for **tinxy-local**.
   - When prompted, enter the API key to link the device with the integration (If you have an exising device you can choese to use existing token ).

### Prompt Details for Tinxy Local Integration

When setting up each device with the **tinxy-local** integration, you’ll encounter a series of prompts that guide you through the setup. Here’s what to expect:

1. **API Key Prompt**:
   - The first prompt will ask you to enter your **API key**.
   - This key is required to link your Home Assistant instance with your Tinxy account.
   
2. **Device Selection Prompt**:
   - After entering the API key, the integration will retrieve a list of devices associated with your account.
   - You will be prompted to **select a device** from this list. Choose the specific device you wish to configure.
   - Next need to enter the **IP address** of the selected device in the **Host** column.
   - This IP should be the local IP address of the device on your network (Adding will fail if the device is not correct / Local API is not available), allowing Home Assistant to communicate directly with it over the local API.

These prompts ensure that each device is correctly authenticated, selected, and connected over your local network. Repeat these steps for each additional device you wish to add to Home Assistant.

Repeat this process for each additional device you wish to add.

### Step 3: Verify Local API Connectivity (Prior to Adding Each Device)

1. **Check Device’s Local API Support**:
   - For each device, visit `[device_ip]/info` to confirm local API support is enabled.
2. **Local API Connection Troubleshooting**:
   - If the device fails to toggle or respond correctly, Avoid rapid repeated toggling, as this can cause the local API to freeze, If toggling fails after multiple attempts, try resetting your device.


### Step 4: Troubleshooting

1. **Access to Samba**:
   - Ensure that you have Samba or another file access method enabled to manually modify files if necessary.
2. **Manual Reset**:
   - If the integration fails for any device, you may need to manually delete the tinxy-local files:
     - Access your Home Assistant installation’s `custom_components` directory.
     - Remove any existing tinxy-local files.
     - Reboot Home Assistant.
